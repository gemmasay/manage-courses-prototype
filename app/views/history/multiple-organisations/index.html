      <p>The way DfE models organisations is different to the way they’ve been modelled in UCAS. Some users will have access to multipe UCAS institutions.</p>

      <p>We are still tightly coupled with UCAS’s course model. To avoid creating mental load between our tool and UCAS’s we are not merging organisations and their courses. Users will instead see a list of organisations that they have access to when they log in.</p>

      <p>Examples of ‘SCITT-schools’:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>2Schools Consortium / Oakthorpe Primary School</li>
        <li>Astra SCITT / Dr Challoner's Grammar School</li>
        <li>Bishop Ramsey Church of England School / Hillingdon SCITT</li>
        <li>Bradford Birth to 19 SCITT / St Edmund's Nursery School and Children's Centre</li>
        <li>Buckingham Partnership / Royal Latin School</li>
        <li>Chepping View Primary Academy / Chepping View Primary Academy SCITT</li>
        <li>Cheshire East SCITT / Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">Differences from a single org user</h2>

      <p>The first page a user sees is the organisations view. This is not part of the journey for a user belonging to a single organisation.</p>

      <p>The breadcrumb trail on the courses and course page needs to include ‘Organisations’ as the first crumb.</p>

      <p>The top-level school and organisation links in the header have been removed as it’d be ambiguous which organisation they’d link to. The ‘Publish teacher training courses’ link goes to the organisations page.</p>

      <p>Access requests are still per-organisation.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">Notes</h2>

      <p>The name against the sign out link should be the DfE user, not the organisation – this is for all users.</p>

      <p>We’ve avoided adding supporting copy pending a round of research to see how well this is understood.</p>
